                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <P>gemsbok, (Oryx gazella), species of oryx, or large antelope, that lives in desert regions of 
                    Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Gemsbok are the largest species of oryx and are powerfully 
                    built, with sturdy, muscular bodies. 
                    They are known in particular for their striking coloration, being gray-brown with contrasting 
                    black and white markings on the face and legs and a long black tail. 
                    They also have remarkable horns, which are long, straight, and backward-pointing.

Gemsbok stand up to 138 cm (54 inches) tall at the shoulder. 
Bulls weigh between about 230 and 250 kg (500 and 550 pounds), 
while cows weigh about 200 kg (440 pounds). Gemsbok of both sexes have horns, 
which can reach lengths of 120 cm (47 inches). 
The horns are used as defensive weapons against predators such as lions, African wild dogs, and hyenas. 
Bulls also use their horns to fight each other.
