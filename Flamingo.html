                <h3>FLAMINGO</h3>
                <P>Flamingos are a wading bird, which means they are found along shorelines and on mudflats 
                    foraging for food in the shallow water. They build nests out of mud near coastlines and 
                    water, with enough room to incubate one large egg.
There are 6 flamingo species in total, with 4 in the Amercias, and 2 present in Africa, Asia and Europe. 
The tallest, the greater flamingo, can reach nearly 5 feet in height, while the lesser flamingo is only 
around 2.5 feet tall.
Currently, there are no flamingo species that are classified as endangered. However, there has recently been 
a decline in their numbers and the Andean flamingo is classified as vulnerable by the ICUN. 
The lesser flamingo, Chilean flamingo and Jamesâ€™s flamingo are all near threatened.
Global warming, habitat destruction, and food deficiencies are impacting populations around the globe. 
Some populations migrate throughout the year, making the study of certain groups more difficult.
The pink coloring of a flamingo comes from beta-carotene pigments found in foods such as shrimp. 
The more pigment a bird consumes, the more saturated in color their feathers will be.
Caribbean flamingos are believed to have the brightest bodies. 1
